## 🔍 **Patient Data Clustering** 📊

Explore the breakdown of patient data into three distinct clusters, meticulously categorized based on disease severity. Leveraging the potent Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering algorithm, our system assesses crucial health metrics like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more.

Discover the clusters:

🔴 **Cluster 1**: Intense Disease Severity  
🟡 **Cluster 2**: Moderate Disease Severity  
🟢 **Cluster 3**: Low Disease Severity  

Dive into the nuances of each cluster and unravel the insights within! 🌟✨
